# Copilot Instructions

This file gives GitHub Copilot the project context it needs when working on SEP. Both Copilot code review and the Copilot cloud agent read it, so it carries only guidance that applies whether Copilot is reviewing a diff or writing one. Per-area rules live under `.github/instructions/`; how to word a review lives in `.github/instructions/code-review.instructions.md`, which the cloud agent is excluded from.

## Project shape

SEP is a FastAPI application with three mounted sub-applications, each with its own database, Alembic migration chain, and Celery beat:

- `app/inventory/` — nodes, services, schemas, tables; mounted at `/api/inventory`.
- `app/tasks/` — task execution, Nomad/local executors, periodic tasks; mounted at `/api/tasks`.
- `app/sep/` — the SEP API gateway, OAuth, apps; mounted at `/`. It serves the React SPA's static assets, not server-rendered pages.

SEP apps are FastAPI routers under `app/sep/apps/<name>/` with `routes.py`, `deps.py`, and optional `models.py`. `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]` aliases live in `deps.py`.

The UI is **API-first + React** — see `api-first.instructions.md` for rules that apply when a PR touches the API gateway, app schemas, or `frontend/packages/`. The server-rendered Jinja2 layer was deleted in SEP-1687; the only Jinja left in the tree renders the report PDF.

## Repo-wide rules (apply to every PR)

- **PR title** follows `SEP-XXX: <description>` — colon, space, non-empty description — when a Jira ticket is associated. Exempt: dependency bumps, version bumps, release branches.
- **HTTP status codes**: `fastapi.status` constants (`status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND`) — never raw integers — in route decorators, exception raises, test assertions, `JSONResponse`.
- **Prefer named project exceptions over raw `fastapi.HTTPException`.** Direct `fastapi.HTTPException` is a tech-debt signal — check `app/core/exceptions.py` and `app/core/auth/exceptions.py` first (`HTTPNotFoundException`, `HTTPConflictException`, `HTTPForbiddenException`, `HTTPGoneException`, `HTTPBadRequestException`, etc. already exist). This matters especially when the same `fastapi.HTTPException(status_code=…, detail=…)` shape appears in 2+ places with the same custom params — that repetition should become a named exception class.
- **Changelog fragments** — user-facing PRs add a file under `changelog.d/` via `make changelog-add TICKET=SEP-XXX SECTION=<added|changed|fixed|security|breaking|config> MSG="…"`. Skip for purely internal changes (CI, refactors, tooling, docs with no user-visible effect), for same-release-cycle fixes (regression from a sibling ticket sharing the unreleased `Fix Version`, linked in Jira via `is caused by`), and for framework-spine-uniform surface (a verb/param/field a shared framework like `TaskExecutionApp` ships once and every migrating app inherits identically — documented once when the framework ships it; add a fragment only for the app-specific delta). Don't expect edits to `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` — that section is assembled at release time.
- **No emojis** in code, comments, docstrings, or commit messages unless the file already uses them.
- **No new files** unless required by the change. Prefer editing existing modules.
- **Dependency edits**: when `pyproject.toml` changes a dependency declaration (`tool.poetry.dependencies`, `tool.poetry.group.*.dependencies`), `poetry.lock` must be updated together via `poetry add` / `poetry remove` / `poetry update`. Non-dependency edits to `pyproject.toml` (ruff config, tool sections) don't require a lockfile update.
