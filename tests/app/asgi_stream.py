"""Drive an ASGI app directly so a response body can be observed mid-flight.

Both HTTP clients the suite otherwise uses buffer the whole response before
returning it: ``httpx.ASGITransport`` runs the app to completion collecting body
parts, and ``fastapi.testclient.TestClient`` writes every body message into a
``BytesIO`` through its portal. Neither can observe a first chunk, act, and then
read the rest, so a test that has to interleave with a live response (fire a
settings rebind while a stream is open, then assert the stream survived it)
cannot be written on either.

This driver calls the app itself and surfaces each ``http.response.body``
message as the app sends it, giving the test a synchronization point in the
middle of a streaming response with no server and no extra thread.
