"""Assert ``Ui`` text coverage over the MySQL Backups create and restore forms.

Covers the two operator-facing texts a form declares: the helper text every
declared field owes, and the consequence text only the destructive ones carry.
Shared by the two apps' contract tests, which make the same promise about two
different forms. The checks stay app-local on purpose: the other schema-driven
apps are only partly described, so promoting them to a registry-wide
conformance rule would fail them.
