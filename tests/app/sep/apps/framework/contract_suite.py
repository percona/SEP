"""Provide the parameterized derived-router contract suite for ``TaskExecutionApp``.

:class:`DerivedRouterContractTests` is a pytest mixin a plugin test module
subclasses, binding its definition to the ``app_def`` class attribute::

    class TestChecksumsContract(DerivedRouterContractTests):
        app_def = checksums_app

pytest collects the inherited ``test_*`` methods — one per derived surface — so a
failure pinpoints the broken surface. Each method reads the contract from the
definition's knobs (``capabilities``, ``pagination``, ``connectivity_check``,
``detail_path_param``, ``capabilities_provider``) rather than hard-coded paths:
a disabled verb asserts route *absence* via route-table introspection, not an
ambiguous HTTP status. The kit's ``conftest.py`` supplies the fixtures the
methods request (``contract_client``, ``unauthenticated_contract_client``,
``mock_task_api``, ``mock_inventory_api``), each reading ``request.cls.app_def``.
