"""Wire the Golden Task plugin as a declarative ``TaskExecutionApp``.

The registry discovers the exported ``app`` and mounts its derived router, which
serves the schema, list, detail, create, update, execute, and delete surfaces.
Set ``group`` / ``nav_order`` to place the app in the sidebar, or
``service_type`` plus ``list_filter=ListFilterConfig(...)`` to expose list filters.
