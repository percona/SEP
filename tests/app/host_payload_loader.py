"""Load one host-side payload under the interpreter running this script.

:mod:`tests.app.host_payloads` runs this file as a subprocess of the oldest Python
an executor host may carry: ``python3.9 -I host_payload_loader.py <payload>
[argv...]``, with the parent interpreter's ``sys.stdlib_module_names`` as a JSON
list on stdin, since 3.9 has no such attribute. The payload runs under a module
name other than ``__main__``, so its module-level code and definitions execute
while its entry point does not. Exit status 0 means it loaded.

A top-level import the parent does not know as standard library is stubbed, which
is how an executor host's driver packages are stood in for. A standard-library
module that 3.9 lacks, such as ``tomllib``, is known to the parent and so is left
to fail for real.

It is its own module rather than part of that one because it runs under the
payload's interpreter: it imports only the standard library, and it must stay
valid Python 3.9 even though ruff lints it for 3.11.
