# SEP Task Execution — Data Flow Diagram

Customer-facing documentation of how data moves through the **Services Enablement Platform (SEP)** during a typical predefined task execution, including the parallel audit and logging path.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Rounded rectangle `([...])` | External entity (engineer, Grafana/PMM, Nomad, log stack) |
| Rectangle `[...]` | Process (SEP/Tasks/Celery components) |
| Cylinder `[(...)]` | Data store (PostgreSQL, snippet files, Nomad runtime) |
| Solid arrow | Primary data flow |
| Dotted arrow | Secondary / read / alternate path |

### Authentication (engineers)

In the shipped PMM-embedded deployment, identity comes from **PMM's Grafana**. The browser's existing PMM session cookie rides a same-origin request to `POST /api/oauth/session/exchange`; SEP validates that session against Grafana, maps the org role, and returns a **short-lived SEP-signed bearer token** in the response body. No SEP cookie is set and no refresh token is issued — when the bearer expires the SPA repeats the exchange. Subsequent API calls carry the SEP bearer as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Casdoor OAuth remains a configurable alternative (`AuthProviderEnum.CASDOOR`) but is not selected by the embedded profile.

**X.509 certificates are not used for engineer identity.** Certificates secure **transport** (HTTPS and inter-service mTLS).

### Predefined commands only

The UI does not submit arbitrary shell commands. SEP uses two main execution patterns:

#### Path A — One-shot execute (snippets, dipper)

| Step | What the engineer does | What the server enforces |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Run | Pick an **approved** snippet (or dipper collector) and submit a **schema-defined** form | No saved task definition; `meta` is built on each run |
| Command | Never typed by the user | Fixed Nomad job type (`exec-artifact`, etc.) plus server-built `meta` (target, interpreter, signed artifact URL) |

**Snippets:** `POST /api/apps/snippets/snippet/execute?snippet_filename=...` → SEP → Tasks API `POST /execute/{execution_task_name}` where `execution_task_name` resolves to `exec-artifact` for bash snippets and `exec-python-artifact` for Python snippets with requirements.
**Dipper:** `POST /api/apps/dipper/` → same Tasks execute pattern with dipper script metadata.

#### Path B — Create then execute (proxy apps: checksums, alters)

| Step | What the engineer does | What the server enforces |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Create** | Fill an app form (e.g. MySQL service, databases, checksum options) | App resolves inventory entities and builds a **PROXY** task: fixed `meta.command` (e.g. `pt-table-checksum`), `meta.args`, `meta.target` stored in Tasks DB |
| **Execute** | Click **Execute** on a saved task (optional ETA / task chain) | Request body does **not** include a new shell command; Tasks API **merges** stored `meta` from the task definition (`prepare_task_history` for `TaskBackendEnum.PROXY`) |
| **Nomad** | — | Dispatches underlying `run-command` job with merged meta |

**Checksums example (canonical Path B):**

1. **Create:** `POST /api/apps/checksums/` — `build_checksums_spec` assembles `pt-table-checksum` with args from inventory (`app/sep/apps/checksums/spec.py`), with the legacy Jinja form path using (`app/sep/apps/checksums/deps.py`, `_assemble_checksum_payload`).
2. **Persist:** `POST /api/tasks/` — task row with `owner=CHECKSUMS`, `backend=PROXY`, `data.task=run-command`.
3. **Execute:** `POST /api/apps/checksums/{task_name}/execute` — body may only contain `eta`, `chain_task_names`, `chain_on_failure`; command comes from stored task (`app/sep/apps/framework/api.py`, `derive_execute_route`, which posts to `POST /api/tasks/execute/{task_name}`).

The same two-phase pattern applies to **alters** (`command: pt-online-schema-change`).

The Nomad `run-command` template runs `${NOMAD_META_command}` with args from meta; the UI never supplies a free-form command string at execute time.

### What is logged

| Data | Storage | When |
|------|---------|------|
| User identity | `taskhistory.executed_by` (authenticated user id; `"SYSTEM"` for periodic runs) | Task dispatch |
| Timestamps | `created_at`, `started_at`, `finished_at` | Create + executor sync |
| Command context | `execution_request` JSON (`task`, `target`, `meta`, `payload`) | Create |
| Output | `taskhistory_log` (stdout/stderr chunks) | During/after run |
| Lifecycle | Nomad `task_states` → execution events API | Sync |
| External timeline | PMM annotations | Start / terminal status |
| HTTP context | `request_id`, `correlation_id`, `user` in app logs | Each request (infra stack, not Tasks DB) |

Optional **Presidio anonymization** may mask log content when `anonymize_mask` is enabled for a task owner.

### Where logs live and who can access them

| Store | Access |
|-------|--------|
| **Tasks PostgreSQL** (`taskhistory`, `taskhistory_log`) | Any **authenticated** OAuth user can read task history and logs by ID. A separate `SEP_INTERNAL_TOKEN` service principal (synthetic non-admin user `sep-service`, id `00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000`) can authenticate for service-to-service calls and has the same read scope as a regular authenticated user. General list/retrieve APIs do **not** filter by `executed_by`. |
| **PMM** | Users with PMM annotation access for the environment. |
| **Infrastructure logs** | Platform operators with access to the deployment log pipeline. |
| **Snippet approval** | **Admin** users only. Single approve: `PUT /api/apps/snippets/snippet/approval?snippet_filename=...`. Bulk approve: `PATCH /api/apps/snippets/approvals`. Both gated via the `ApiAdminUser` dependency. |

No per-row owner filter is applied to general task history / log reads. Future versions may add filtering for specific task / meta combinations.

## Edit the diagrams

1. Install [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) support in your editor, or use [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live).
2. Edit `.mmd` files in this directory.
3. Re-export PDF (see below) before customer delivery.

Alternative: import `.mmd` into [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) for GUI editing, then export PDF manually.

**Sequence diagram editing:** `mermaid-cli` fails on semicolons, curly braces, and some punctuation inside `Note over` lines and message text. Keep labels simple or split Path B into separate `rect` blocks (as in `sep-task-execution-sequence.mmd`).

## Export PDF

`mermaid-cli` drives a headless Chrome to render the diagram, so it needs a browser
on the machine. Point it at a system Chromium with
`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`, or install one for Puppeteer once with
`npx puppeteer browsers install chrome-headless-shell`. Without either, the commands
below fail with a misleading *"Could not find Chrome"*.

From the repository root:

```bash
npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli \
  -i docs/customer/sep-task-execution-dfd/sep-task-execution-dfd.mmd \
  -o docs/customer/sep-task-execution-dfd/exports/sep-task-execution-dfd.pdf \
  -b white

# Optional: sequence diagram PDF
npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli \
  -i docs/customer/sep-task-execution-dfd/sep-task-execution-sequence.mmd \
  -o docs/customer/sep-task-execution-dfd/exports/sep-task-execution-sequence.pdf \
  -b white
```

Commit the updated `.mmd` sources with any README/checklist changes. The PDF under `exports/` may be committed or produced at release time; if committed, regenerate whenever sources change.

## Out of scope

- Certificate-based **user** login (not implemented in default SEP)
- Full Nomad/PMM deployment topology (see [Nomad driver & deployment](../nomad-driver-deployment.md))
- Celery-only (non-Nomad) executors except where noted
- Inventory sync flows unrelated to task execution
