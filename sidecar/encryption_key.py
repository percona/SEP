"""Resolve the side-car's ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` before supervisord starts.

``entrypoint.sh`` runs this once, after ``settings-env.sh`` has expanded the
deployment inputs, and only when neither an explicit ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` nor a
file of that name under ``SECRETS_DIR`` already supplied one. Stdout carries
the resolved key and nothing else; every diagnostic goes to stderr. Both
channels are re-read here anyway so a run outside the entrypoint answers the
same thing the container would.

Unlike the Grafana token beside it, this key is not re-mintable. Every
``settingoverride`` row SEP has encrypted is readable only under the key that
wrote it, and :mod:`~app.core.settings_override.cache` warns and skips a row it
cannot decrypt rather than failing the load, so minting a replacement over
surviving ciphertext brings the container up green with the affected overrides
silently reverted to their YAML values. Minting therefore happens only where all
three service databases are provably free of ciphertext, and any database that
cannot be reached counts as unproven.

The freshness probe reads the databases through :class:`_ServiceDatabase`
subclasses rather than the services' own settings classes. Those resolve the
same ``<PREFIX>__DATABASE__*`` sources (environment, dotenv, ``SECRETS_DIR``
file, YAML profile) while requiring no ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` of their own, which
the key-less path this helper runs on could not supply.

Deployment inputs, all optional: ``SEP_STATE_DIR`` and
``SEP_ENCRYPTION_PROBE_TIMEOUT``.
