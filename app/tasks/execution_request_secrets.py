"""Encrypt and decrypt the credential-bearing leaves of a stored execution request.

Three leaves of the ``taskhistory.execution_request`` document carry credentials
verbatim: ``meta.args`` holds the joined command line an operator submitted,
``meta.config`` the serialised configuration an app rendered from its form, and
``payload`` a submitted document or the ``file://`` reference standing in for
one. Which leaves those are is fixed here by name and never inferred from a
value's shape or content, so a credential that happens to look like something
else is protected on the same terms as any other.

The inventory is the only place they are named. A ``meta`` leaf added to it
becomes ciphertext in the column while every caller still holds a value, so any
SQL predicate over that key has to skip it or compare a value against a token
and silently never match; :data:`ENCRYPTED_META_KEYS` exists so that skip
follows the inventory rather than being restated beside it.

Each leaf is stored as ``encrypt(json.dumps(value))``. The JSON wrapper is what
lets ``meta.args`` stay the ``Any``-typed value the API accepts, so a ``str``,
``list``, ``dict`` or ``int`` all round-trip to the type they were written with,
while :func:`~app.core.encryption.encrypt` still receives the ``str`` it
requires. A leaf that is absent or ``None`` is left alone: there is no value to
protect, and encrypting it would replace a stored JSON ``null`` with a token, so
every reader that distinguishes "no payload" from "a payload" would stop being
able to.

Deciding *whether* to encrypt splits by who supplied the document, which is why
the write path and the migration are separate functions rather than one with a
flag. :func:`encrypt_request_leaves` receives freshly-submitted values and
encrypts unconditionally; :func:`reencrypt_request_leaves` receives stored rows
and skips what :func:`~app.core.encryption.is_encrypted` already accepts.
