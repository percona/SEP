"""Resolve plugin-specific failure-alert enrichment via a per-task hook.

The tasks service owns the generic failure-alert path but must stay free of any
static ``app.sep`` import: plugin domain knowledge (e.g. the archiver
``PURGE_LIST`` schema) lives in the plugin package, not here. Rather than the
core enumerating plugins by owner, each task *carries* its enrichment builder:
the owning plugin stamps a ``"module:function"`` string onto
``Task.alert_detail_builder`` at creation, and this task resolves it lazily via
the shared :func:`app.tasks.hook_resolver.resolve_hook` the first time the
task's alert fires. The
dependency points the right way — core discovers, the plugin declares — so a new
plugin needs no edit here. This mirrors how the Celery executor resolves a task
``callable`` by path.

Resolving lazily from the task — rather than a core registry populated at import
time — is what keeps this enumeration-free across the three processes that fire
``alert_for_status`` and share no plugin-bootstrap step: the Celery worker, the
SEP app, and the tasks API. A core registry would only cover whichever process
happened to import the plugin; a path carried on the task resolves identically
in all three.
