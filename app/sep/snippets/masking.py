"""Replace credential values in a recorded snippet argument string with a mask.

A snippet's arguments are recorded as the ``shlex.join``ed command line the
execution ran with, so the credentials an operator typed into the execution form
are present verbatim. Any surface that replays that line has to redact them
first.

Redaction works on the token list ``shlex.split`` recovers, never on a regex over
the joined string: each parameter carries its own ``arg_format`` template, so
there is no single argument shape to match. A parameter's emitted token shape is
derived by calling the production renderer
(:meth:`~app.sep.snippets.models.snippet.BaseSnippetArgs.format_args`) with a
sentinel value, which keeps the positional / flag / default-format resolution
rules in one place.

Three independent signals fire over the same token list: the declared
parameter's metadata, an argument *name* that reads as a credential, and an
argument *value* shaped like a URL with embedded userinfo. The third is not
redundant -- a parameter named ``mongodb-uri`` carries a password while matching
no credential word.
