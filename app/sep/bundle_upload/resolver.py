"""Resolve the effective delivery plan from the baked skeleton and its inputs.

This module must stay out of ``app/sep/bundle_upload/__init__.py``:
``app.sep.config`` imports :class:`~app.sep.bundle_upload.plan.DeliveryPlan` from
this package, so the package ``__init__`` executes while ``app.sep.config`` is
still running its own module body, and importing ``sep_settings`` from there
would fail. Import this module directly instead, as ``app.sep.apps.atw.send``
already does for ``factory``.

    plan has passed the same cross-reference checks a file-configured one does.

    Every unconfigured and every invalid case resolves to a reason rather than

    applied unconditionally in the same overlay, so a row whose secret names no
    longer fit can also point delivery at a receiver this plan never named.

    Check order carries meaning. A deployment with no baked plan is
    unconfigured, never drifted — there is nothing to have drifted from. Drift
    is then decided before the empty-value check, because a rename produces both
