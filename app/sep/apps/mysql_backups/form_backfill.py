    A stored config written before the create form required a backup directory has
    no ``BACKUP_DIR`` key, so the reconstructed body omits ``backup_dir``.
    Validating that against the strict create model would skip the task, and a task
    with no ``_form`` stamp has no Edit affordance at all — leaving an operator able
    to delete and recreate it but not to repair it. The rejection belongs on the
    create and update routes, which keep
    :class:`~app.sep.apps.mysql_backups.forms.BackupCreate`.

    The field is declared exactly as the create model declared it before the
    tightening, ``NonEmptyStr`` and not ``StrippedNonEmptyStr``: the older form
    accepted a whitespace-only directory, the payload joined it as a relative path,
    and those tasks ran and reported success, so they are part of the population
    that has to reconstruct rather than be skipped.

    The binary/compression rules are dropped for the same reason: a task saved
    before the form gated compression on the backup binary can hold a pairing the
    create model now rejects, and the operator needs the edit form to load in order
    to correct it. The rejection stays on the create and update routes, so saving
    the reopened form still fails until the algorithm matches the binary.
