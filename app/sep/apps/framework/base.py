class BaseApp(BaseModel):
    """Represent a mounted SEP app as a uniform registry entry.

    Authored directly by a declarative app (``app = BaseApp(...)``) or
    synthesized by :func:`app.sep.apps.framework.registry.build_app_registry`
    from a legacy ``App`` settings entry, so legacy and definition-based apps
    share one shape. ``enabled`` is an activation-list fact stamped by the
    registry rather than author-set; ``display_name`` defaults to ``name``.
    ``key`` is stamped from the module path (scoped for nested sub-apps) when
    the definition leaves it unset, but an author may set it explicitly to
    override the derivation.

    :param key: The scoped app key. Left unset, the registry stamps the
        module-path-derived key; set explicitly, the author's value wins.
    :param name: The app's internal name.
    :param display_name: The human-facing label; defaults to ``name`` when absent.
    :param uri_path: The Jinja mount prefix and sidebar link target.
    :param css_class: The sidebar CSS class.
    :param sidebar: Whether the app appears in the sidebar.
    :param group: The nav group key this app nests under; ``None`` renders it
        as a top-level sidebar entry.
    :param nav_order: The app's sort position within the sidebar; ``None`` sorts
        last.
    :param react_route: The canonical React route the shell mounts and links to;
        ``None`` resolves to ``/apps/<key>`` in the ``GET /api/apps`` response.
    :param nav_icon: The sidebar icon key; ``None`` falls back to the frontend's
        default app icon.
    :param enabled: The seed-time enabled default; stamped by the registry.
    :param custom_ui: Whether the app ships a bespoke React UI.
    :param api_router: The plugin's JSON ``APIRouter``, when it exposes one.
    :param jinja_router: The plugin's Jinja ``APIRouter``.
    :param app_schema: The plugin's schema definition, aliased ``schema`` for
        authoring; ``None`` for legacy-wrapped apps.
    :param parent_key: The key of the parent app that structurally owns this one,
        or ``None`` for a top-level app. A child is registered by its parent's
        ``child_apps`` (never a ``settings.yaml`` entry) and owns no ``AppState``
        row: its runtime enabled/lifecycle state derives from the parent's (see
        :attr:`state_key`), and it cannot be toggled independently.
    :param child_apps: Pre-built child apps this app structurally owns. The
        registry appends each right after this app and stamps its ``enabled`` from
        this app's, so a child is mounted and snapshotted exactly when its parent
        is. Each child must set ``parent_key`` to this app's key.
    :param requires_apps: App **keys** (not display names) this app functionally
        depends on. An app's *effective* enabled state ANDs its own ``AppState``
        with the effective state of every app named here, so a disabled dependency
        hides and gates this app too. Depending on a protected app (one that can
        never be disabled) is a harmless no-op. Keys are validated at
        registry-build time: an unknown key, a self-dependency, or a cycle fails
        fast. See :meth:`AppRegistry.resolve_effective_enabled`.
    :param artifact_base_dirs: A mapping from each artifact-type discriminator
        this app owns to a thunk returning that type's download base directory.
        The generic artifact-download route flattens these across the registry
        to resolve a signed token to a file on disk; defaults to empty.
    :param static_mounts: Authenticated static mounts for the app's payload
        directories, collected from the registry and mounted in ``app/sep/main.py``
        through :class:`~app.sep.utils.static.AuthenticatedStaticFiles`. Defaults to
        an empty tuple.
    :param uses_task_data: Whether the app's UI consumes the shared task-history
        routes (``/files``, ``/stream-logs``, ``/execution-events``). Any app in the
        registry declaring it mounts those routers for the whole deployment.
        :class:`~app.sep.apps.framework.apps.TaskExecutionApp` overrides the default
        to ``True`` because its derived list and detail surfaces always render them.
        Defaults to ``False``.
