"""Cross-check a not-yet-migrated plugin's create model against its hand-written schema.

This is a transitional, warning-level drift detector for plugins that still
declare their form fields twice (a Pydantic create model and a hand-written
:class:`~app.sep.apps.framework.schema.AppSchema`). It compares the
cheaply-derivable surface — field presence, scalar field kind, required-ness, and
default — and never blocks. A silent (empty) result means "no presence, kind, or
required disagreement", **not** "wire-identical": choice/reference/widget kinds,
constraints, gates, and section metadata are out of its scope and remain the
golden byte-compare's responsibility.
