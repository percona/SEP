    ``Choices`` / ``Requires`` / ``Forbidden``). That one declaration drives both
    runtime validation and schema export: at class definition the conditional

__conditional_rules_plan__` so the inherited validator enforces them, while

    :param alert_on_fail: Whether to alert on task failure and auto-resolve on a
        later success. Excluded from the derived schema — the framework renders it
        from the ``alert_on_fail`` capability — yet validated in the JSON body so
        every model-first form accepts it. Defaults to ``False``.
