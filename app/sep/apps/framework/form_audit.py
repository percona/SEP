"""Read-only audit of ``data['_form']`` stamps against each app's create model.

A stamp is the create body as the form looked when the task was saved, and the
edit form reloads it verbatim — so a form gate added afterwards turns a saved
task into one that cannot be re-saved until an operator changes it. This module
reports that population without touching it: for every app that declares a
backfill entry it validates each active task's stamp against the model that
app's create and update routes enforce, and names the tasks a save would now
reject. Deactivated rows are out of scope, as they are for the backfill.

The report goes to stdout, because the report *is* the output; progress goes to
the log. It never writes, and it never prints a submitted value: a form body
holds GPG recipients and key-file paths, and every pydantic error carries the
input that failed, so findings carry field locations and the rule messages only.
