"""Define the ``ScriptSource`` seam for script-backed task apps.

A script-backed task app has no single create model: each script carries its own
dynamically-synthesised form, and its surface is script-centric (listing,
per-script form schema, execute, history) rather than the model-first ``POST /``
create envelope. :class:`ScriptSource` captures the hooks
:func:`~app.sep.apps.framework.api.derive_script_routes` needs to derive that
surface, so a :class:`~app.sep.apps.framework.apps.TaskExecutionApp` can declare
``script_source=`` instead of hand-wiring the routing and execution.

The framework programs against the structural :class:`ScriptProtocol` and never
imports a concrete script type; the concrete type, the listing source (disk or
DB), the artifact-URL salt, and the execution-meta shape are all supplied by the
consumer.

    the execution-meta assembly (closing over its own artifact-URL salt and meta
    shape). ``build_execution_meta`` receives the script and the validated
    :class:`ScriptExecuteWrite`, so a consumer reads ``executor_host`` / ``sudo`` /

    :param script_dir: The directory the scripts live in (the static-mount target and
        the listing root the consumer's hooks close over).

        resolved (an absent key means unresolved). When ``None`` the framework's
        :func:`resolve_scripts` falls back to looping ``load_script`` (see there),
        so a source that does not opt in keeps working unchanged.
    :param build_form_schema: Synthesise a per-script :class:`AppSchema` from the
        script's frontmatter parameters.
    :param build_execution_meta: Assemble the execution-meta model the framework
        posts to the Tasks API, from the script and the validated request body.
    :param list_response: Project a script into its list-row response model.
    :param static_schema: The optional plugin-level schema served at ``GET /schema``;
        when ``None`` the route is not registered.
    :param list_response_model: The optional response model typing the derived
        ``GET /`` as ``list[list_response_model]``; when ``None`` the list route
        stays untyped (back-compatible — a source that does not opt in keeps the
        original untyped list).
    :param list_query_dep: An optional source-supplied request-boundary dependency
        yielding the ``Q`` handed to ``list_scripts``. Set it when the resource adds
        filter parameters on top of sort and search: the dependency composes the Core
        one (built from the app's spec) with its own ``Query`` params, so the spec
        stays the single authority for the sortable allowlist while the route also
        carries the resource's base restrictions. When ``None`` (default) the
        framework builds the dependency from the app's spec directly.
    :param in_memory_list_query: Whether the source materializes its whole set and
        applies sort/search/pagination in-process (a disk-backed source) rather than
        pushing them down to SQL. Selects which list-query dependency the framework
        builds for the app's :class:`~app.core.db.list_query.ListQuerySpec` — the
        in-memory dep (:func:`~app.sep.apps.framework.list_query.make_in_memory_list_query_dep`)
