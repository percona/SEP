"""Define shared route helpers for schema-driven plugin routers.

The helpers in this module register a plugin's well-known routes with a
single call so plugins never re-implement the auth posture, response-model
wiring, or status-code conventions:

- :func:`schema_endpoint` and :func:`capabilities_endpoint` register the
  ``GET /schema`` and ``GET /capabilities`` discovery routes.
- :func:`derive_crud_routes` builds a plugin router carrying the schema
  route plus the standard list / detail / create (and optional update /
  delete) CRUD routes, composing the shared framework task helpers for the
  handler bodies.

Pagination convention: paginate anything backed by an unbounded resource and
return a :class:`~app.core.pagination.PaginatedResponse` envelope; a bare list
is acceptable only for compile-time-bounded enumerations. Hand-written proxy
list routes build the envelope with
:func:`~app.core.pagination.build_proxied_page`, which corrects the ``total``
when rows are filtered in-process.

    Semantics:

    - The provider is invoked **per request**, never cached, so a
      deployment-config hot reload between two calls is reflected on the
      next response without a process restart.
    - ``IsApiAuthenticated`` only — there is no admin gate. Capability
      flags are public-to-authed-users by design; if a plugin needs to
      gate privileged flags, expose them on a separate route, not here.
    - The provider must be a function (or method) with a return-type
      annotation that resolves to a :class:`pydantic.BaseModel` subclass.
      Lambdas are rejected because their syntax provides no way to declare
      a return-type annotation.
    - The provider may declare arbitrary parameters; ``functools.wraps``
      preserves the signature so FastAPI inspects it and resolves any
      ``Depends(...)`` defaults per request (settings, session, current
      user, etc.). A zero-arg provider remains the most common shape
      (settings attribute read), but the helper does not enforce it.
    - The provider should be cheap. DB or network calls do not belong
      behind a synchronous provider; add an async-provider variant when
      a plugin needs that. ``async def`` providers are rejected at
      registration to keep the contract sync-only for now.
    - The new endpoint is intentionally separate from
      :class:`~app.sep.apps.framework.schema.AppSchema.capabilities`,
      which describes static UI feature flags (chaining, scheduling,
      alert_on_fail). The two surfaces are not unified: schema-side
      ``Capabilities`` is per-plugin compile-time posture, capability
      responses returned here are per-deployment runtime posture that
      may toggle without a redeploy.

    """Build a plugin router with the standard schema + CRUD routes.

    Register ``GET /schema`` plus standard task-plugin CRUD routes:
    owner-filtered list (``GET /``), detail (``GET /{detail_path_param}``),
    create (``POST /`` with ``201``), and update/delete (``PUT`` / ``DELETE`` on
    ``/{detail_path_param}``; delete uses ``204``). Update and delete derive a
    standard default from ``update_enabled`` / ``delete_enabled`` alone — the PUT
    mirrors create (rebuild the body through ``create_payload``, PUT upstream,
    render through the create-path response surface with the task's latest
    status), the DELETE is the plain fetch-then-delete. A full ``update_handler``
    / ``delete_handler`` overrides that default for cascade plugins.
    All derived routes use ``IsApiAuthenticated`` and
    ``response_model_by_alias=True``. Enabling ``connectivity_check`` extends
    the create route with a post-creation connectivity probe and a
    ``connectivity_warning`` on its response.

    The derived detail route is greedy: ``GET /{detail_path_param}`` captures
    any single collection-root path segment. If a plugin also needs a static
    collection-root ``GET`` route (for example ``GET /capabilities``), prefer
    a hand-written router (or mount that static route under a sub-prefix)
    instead of this helper.

    .. code-block:: python

        from app.sep.apps.framework.api import derive_crud_routes

        router = derive_crud_routes(
            archives_schema,
            task_owner="ARCHIVER",
            get_task=get_archives_task,
            response_builder=build_archives_api_task_response,
            create_payload=build_archives_api_task_payload,
        )

    :param plugin_schema: The plugin's fully-validated schema instance.
    :param task_owner: The task owner the list route filters by.
    :param get_task: The raw ``make_task_dep(owner)`` callable resolving a task
        by name; its inner path parameter must equal ``detail_path_param``.
    :param response_builder: Builds the list/detail response model from a task
        and optional status; its return annotation supplies the response model.
    :param detail_response_builder: Builds the detail response; its return
        annotation supplies the detail route's response model. When ``None`` (the
        default) the detail route falls back to ``response_builder`` and the list
        model, byte-identical to a list/detail-shared model. When set, the create
        route also falls back to this builder/model (a created resource renders like
        its detail view) unless an explicit ``create_response_builder`` is given.
    :param detail_response_model: An explicit detail response model that overrides
        return-annotation inference on ``detail_response_builder`` — supply it when
        the detail builder is an exotic callable whose return type cannot be
        introspected. Defaults to ``None`` (infer from the builder).
    :param create_payload: The raw create-payload builder dependency (declares
        the request ``Body()`` model that drives the create ``422``). When
        ``None`` (the default), no ``POST /`` create route is registered — the
        read-only shape used by an app that exposes schema + list + detail only.
        ``connectivity_check`` and ``create_response_builder`` are create-route
        options, so supplying either with ``create_payload=None`` is rejected.
    :param create_response_builder: Builds the create response from a task;
        its return annotation supplies the create response model. Defaults to
        reusing ``response_builder`` (and its model).
    :param connectivity_check: When ``True``, the create route gains a
        ``check_connectivity`` boolean query parameter (default ``True``), runs
        the post-creation connectivity probe, and returns a create response
        whose ``connectivity_warning`` is populated on probe failure. The create
        response model becomes ``create_response_builder``'s model when given,
        else an auto-derived ``<App>CreateResponse``. When ``False`` (default)
        the create route is unchanged.
    :param detail_path_param: The detail/update/delete path-parameter name;
        must equal ``get_task``'s inner path parameter (``make_task_dep`` uses
        ``task_name``).
    :param pagination_dep: A ``make_pagination_dep(...)`` dependency callable.
        When given, the list route takes that dependency (wrapped in
        ``Annotated[Pagination, Depends(...)]``) and returns a
        ``PaginatedResponse``; when ``None`` the list returns a plain list.
    :param list_status_filter: When ``True``, the list route gains a ``status``
        query parameter wired to the pipeline's ``status_filter``. When ``False``
        (default) the list route declares no ``status`` param.
    :param list_service_type: When set, the list route gains a ``service_type``
        query parameter and short-circuits to an empty result before the upstream
        fetch when the requested service type differs from this one. When ``None``
        (default) the list route declares no ``service_type`` param.
    :param list_extra_params: Fixed upstream task-list query parameters (for
        example ``{"parent_is_null": "true"}``) applied server-side on every list
        request, so they filter without perturbing the paginated ``total``.
        Defaults to ``None`` (no extra params).
    :param derive_list: When ``True`` (default), register the owner-filtered
        derived ``GET /`` list route. Set ``False`` to suppress it so a custom
        collection-root list route (mounted last via ``extra_routes``) wins the
        path.
    :param derive_detail: When ``True`` (default), register the greedy derived
        ``GET /{detail_path_param}`` detail route. Set ``False`` to suppress it so
        a custom detail route (mounted last via ``extra_routes``) wins the path.
    :param context_provider: A zero-arg async provider whose once-awaited result
        is bound as the active builder's ``context`` keyword argument across the
        list, detail, and create builds. ``None`` (default) leaves builders unbound.
    :param create_extra_deps: Extra route dependencies appended to the create
        route after ``IsApiAuthenticated``, never replacing it.
    :param update_enabled: When ``True`` and no ``update_handler`` is supplied,
        mount the derived default ``PUT /{detail_path_param}`` route. Defaults to
        ``False`` (no PUT). Requires ``create_payload`` (the derived PUT rebuilds
        the body through it).
    :param update_handler: A fully-formed update handler that overrides the
        derived default; when given, a ``PUT /{detail_path_param}`` route is
        registered using it. The helper applies only ``IsApiAuthenticated`` and
        ``response_model_by_alias`` — any additional route guard (e.g.
        ``HasNoConflictedRunningTasks``) must be declared as one of the handler's
        own signature dependencies, since the handler is passed as a bare callable
        and carries no decorator-level dependencies into the helper.
    :param update_extra_deps: Route dependencies (guards) appended after
        ``IsApiAuthenticated`` on the *derived* PUT. The caller may resolve these to
        a default guard set or a per-route override (e.g. a protected-task check).
        Rejected alongside a full ``update_handler`` (declare guards in the handler
        signature instead) or when the update capability is off. Defaults to ``()``.
    :param delete_enabled: When ``True`` and no ``delete_handler`` is supplied,
        mount the derived default ``DELETE /{detail_path_param}`` route (plain
        fetch-then-delete, ``204``). Defaults to ``False`` (no DELETE).
    :param delete_handler: A fully-formed delete handler that overrides the
        derived default; when given, a ``DELETE /{detail_path_param}`` route is
        registered using it, with ``status_code=204``. As with ``update_handler``,
        any extra route guard must be declared as one of the handler's own
        signature dependencies.
    :param delete_extra_deps: Route dependencies (guards) appended after
        ``IsApiAuthenticated`` on the *derived* DELETE. The caller may resolve these
        to a default guard set or a per-route override. Rejected alongside a full
        ``delete_handler`` or when the delete capability is off. Defaults to ``()``.
    :return: A plugin ``APIRouter`` carrying the schema + CRUD routes.
    :raises TypeError: If ``response_builder``, ``detail_response_builder``, or
        ``create_response_builder`` is an ``async def`` callable (the derived
        handlers invoke it synchronously), does not declare a return-type
        annotation that is a :class:`pydantic.BaseModel` subclass, or cannot accept
        a ``context`` keyword while ``context_provider`` is set; or if
        ``connectivity_check`` is on and an explicit ``create_response_builder``'s
        model omits a ``connectivity_warning`` field.
    :raises ValueError: If ``create_payload`` is ``None`` while
        ``connectivity_check`` is on or a ``create_response_builder`` is supplied
        (both are create-route options that need a create route to attach to); if
        ``update_extra_deps`` are supplied alongside a full ``update_handler`` or

    The cascade-shaped sibling of :func:`_register_create_route`: where that
    helper POSTs a single task, this one creates a parent task plus its children.
    Each app supplies a ``create_plan`` dependency (the analog of the framework's
    own ``create_payload`` dependency) that builds its writes and returns a
    :class:`CascadeCreatePlan`; the helper owns the invariant sequence — stamp the
    parent form, run the cascade, refetch the canonical parent, build the
    response, and (when ``connectivity_check`` is on) attach the post-creation
    connectivity warning via ``model_copy``.

    The generated handler annotates its ``plan`` parameter with ``create_plan``
    (the plugin's ``Annotated[CascadeCreatePlan, Depends(build_*_cascade_plan)]``
    alias, whose inner dependency declares the JSON request body). With
    ``connectivity_check`` on it gains a ``check_connectivity`` query parameter,
    verbatim from :func:`_register_create_route`.

    Unlike the derived create/execute routes, the migrated cascade create routes
    carry no per-route guard: authentication is inherited from the ``/api`` mount
    and the hand-written handlers declared no route dependencies, so the default
    ``extra_deps=()`` preserves their OpenAPI identity.

    :param router: The plugin's ``APIRouter``.

        dependency alias; its inner dependency declares the JSON request body and
        builds the parent write, form, and cascade closure.
    :param get_task: The by-name task getter, called ``get_task(name, tasks_api)``
        to refetch the canonical parent after the cascade.
    :param response_builder: An async ``(task, tasks_api) -> BaseModel`` builder
        rendering the create response from the refetched parent.
    :param response_model: The create response model; drives the response schema.
    :param connectivity_check: Whether to add the connectivity probe and the

    :param description: The OpenAPI operation ``description``; ``""`` falls back to
        the inner handler's docstring.
    :param status_code: The success status code. Defaults to ``201``.

    Per-script routes carry the script filename in a ``snippet_filename`` query
    parameter under the ``/snippet/`` sub-prefix (never a path segment), so a greedy
    detail route cannot shadow ``GET /`` or ``GET /schema``. The execute route
    validates the request ``args`` against the script's dynamic execution model
    (``422`` on failure), delegates meta assembly to ``source.build_execution_meta``
    with the model's *coerced* ``args`` (so a consumer never sees the raw,
    unnormalised values the dynamic model may have type-cast), and posts
