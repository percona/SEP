"""Share the keying-agnostic bodies the script-backed task apps re-roll.

Below the framework's filename-keyed :class:`~app.sep.apps.framework.script_source.ScriptSource`
seam, ``snippets``, ``dipper``, and ``alert_troubleshooting`` each hand-roll the
same four things: a script preview, a :class:`~app.sep.snippets.models.snippet.SnippetExecutionMeta`
from resolved inputs, the signed artifact-download URL, and the "POST
``/execute/{name}`` then read the created task id" execute tail. Each helper here
takes the *already-resolved* script / meta, so every app keeps its own
script-resolution keying while sharing the body.

:func:`execute_script` sits one level above those: it is the whole validate →
coerce → build-meta → dispatch sequence the derived ``POST /snippet/execute``
route performs, factored out so a caller that dispatches several scripts in one
request (the ATW batch endpoint) drives the identical sequence instead of
re-rolling its subtle arg-coercion contract.
