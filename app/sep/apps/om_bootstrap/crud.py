"""Define reads and writes for :class:`BootstrapRun`.

A plain :class:`~app.core.db.crud.BaseSQLModelManager`, unlike ``om_inventory``'s
own :class:`~app.sep.apps.om_inventory.crud.ProbeRunManager` sibling
(``OmHost``/``OmService``), which hand-writes attribute-by-attribute upserts for
a documented reason — freshness columns a blanket update would silently wipe.
``BootstrapRun`` has no such column: every write here replaces the whole row
(the ``hosts`` document included, per ``models.py``'s "read and written whole"
design), so the manager's generic ``save``/``update`` need no override.
