"""Define the ATW plugin settings section.

The section is read straight off YAML/env rather than mounted as a field on
``SEPSettings``: importing this module runs the ATW package ``__init__``, which
pulls in the app definition and, transitively, ``sep_settings`` -- so a field
default typed with :class:`AtwSettings` would cycle while ``SEPSettings`` is
still being constructed. Consumers import :data:`atw_settings` at call time (the app's
``periodic_task_schedules`` factory and Celery tasks), matching how alerts
reads its section.
