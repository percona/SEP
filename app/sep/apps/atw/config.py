"""Define the ATW plugin settings section.

The section is read straight off YAML/env rather than mounted as a field on
``ExtensionsSettings``: importing this module runs the ATW package ``__init__``, which
pulls in the app definition and, transitively, ``sep_settings`` -- so a field
default typed with :class:`AtwSettings` would cycle while ``ExtensionsSettings`` is
still being constructed. Consumers import :data:`atw_settings` at call time (the app's
``periodic_task_schedules`` factory and Celery tasks), matching how alerts
reads its section.

    :cvar SETTINGS_PREFIXES: The prefixes for ATW-plugin settings in the
        configuration file. Set to ``["EXTENSIONS", "ATW"]`` so the section lives under
        ``EXTENSIONS.ATW``.
    :cvar model_config: The base YAML configuration plus ``env_parse_none_str``,
        without which the ``null`` opt-out both intervals document is unreachable
        from an environment variable. They are optional models, so
        pydantic-settings classifies them complex, JSON-decodes the raw value and
        then drops the resulting ``None`` from the environment source — which
        reads as "unset" and silently restores the compiled-in default. The YAML
        path never needed it: a native ``null`` scalar arrives as ``None`` already.
    :param bundle_dir: Directory where diagnostics bundles are staged while a send
        runs. Written and read by the Celery worker that builds and uploads them.
    :param bundle_ttl: Maximum age (seconds) of a staged bundle before the cleanup
        task removes it.
    :param cleanup_interval: Cadence of the ``purge_atw_bundles`` sweep that
        deletes expired bundles and fails abandoned sends. ``None`` unregisters
        the sweep entirely.
    :param stale_send_after: How long a send may sit in a non-terminal status
        before the sweep concludes its worker is gone and fails it. Must comfortably
        exceed the slowest legitimate send, or a healthy upload is failed mid-flight.
    :param reconcile_interval: Cadence of the ``reconcile_atw_executions`` sweep that
        fills in run outcomes the recorder hook never observed. ``None`` unregisters
        the sweep entirely — which leaves historical executions and the hook's three
        unobserved terminal paths permanently uncounted, so it is an explicit
        operator opt-out rather than a sensible default.
    :param reconcile_batch_size: The most executions one reconcile tick examines.
        Bounds the upstream traffic per tick; every unresolved row is still reached
        within ``ceil(unresolved / batch_size)`` ticks, because selection is
        least-recently-attempted first.
