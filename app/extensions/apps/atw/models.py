"""Define the ATW plugin's DB tables and their API request/response models.

This module is loaded by the Alembic plugin-discovery loader at migration time,
so it must stay self-contained — importing only from ``app.core``, ``pydantic``,
``sqlalchemy``, and ``sqlmodel``, never from sibling plugins or other service
packages (that would register foreign tables in ``SQLModel.metadata`` and leak
them into the ``extensions`` autogenerate). The category taxonomy, which depends on
``app.inventory``, lives in :mod:`app.extensions.apps.atw.categories`.

:mod:`app.tasks.task_status` is the one exception, and it is admitted on the
mechanism rather than by name: the restriction exists to keep foreign **tables** out
of ``SQLModel.metadata``, and that module defines none — it imports only the standard
library, and ``app/tasks/__init__.py`` is licence header only. It exists so
``terminal_status`` can carry the real status enum instead of a bare ``str`` whose
value set nothing constrains. Any other ``app.tasks`` import, or a SQLModel class
appearing in that module, is the leak this paragraph is about.

    The four outcome columns denormalize what the tasks service knows about the

    :func:`app.extensions.apps.atw.recorder.record_atw_run`, which the tasks service calls
    at the terminal transitions it observes, and the ``reconcile_atw_executions``
    sweep, which fills the rest — so a run the hook missed reads as unresolved for up
    to one reconcile interval, longer while a backlog drains. ``terminal_status`` carries
    the shared status enum and its CHECK constraint, so the column cannot hold a value
    the aggregate would silently skip. The enum is imported from
    :mod:`app.tasks.task_status`, a leaf module that defines no tables, so naming it
    here registers nothing of the tasks service's in ``SQLModel.metadata`` — the

        resolves, so no outcome will ever be recorded and the sweep must stop
