    """Resolve the inventory entities a restore form references.

    MyDumper always resolves its MySQL service (eager-raising when ``service_id``
    is unset or stale), splits the service address into ``dest_host`` / ``dest_port``,
    and resolves the optional schema into the restore ``database``. XtraBackup and
    Binlog have no destination service: a ``service_id`` of ``None`` or the
    ``UNKNOWN_SERVICE_SENTINEL`` placeholder skips the lookup, and a stale id whose
    service was deleted degrades to a node-only annotation on a 404.

    ``ServiceRef(allow_custom=True)`` also lets the form submit a typed service
    name instead of an inventory id. A name is never a valid detail-route segment,
    so it annotates XtraBackup and Binlog restores as-is and is rejected for
    MyDumper, which needs the service address to derive its destination.

    A resolved service whose address carries no port yields ``dest_host`` alone,
    and the payload applies its own ``3306`` default. One resolving to no address
    at all is rejected rather than tolerated: an unset ``dest_host`` drops
    ``DEST_HOST`` from the emitted config, which the payload reads as
    ``localhost`` and loads into whatever MySQL runs on the executor instead of
    the destination the operator chose.

    directly keeps the served stamp exactly what a subsequent ``PUT`` would
