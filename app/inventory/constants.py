#: and one whose clock is then corrected is locked out for the whole interval.
#: Refusing leaves the entity looking stale, which is the direction the rest of
#: this mechanism already errs in. Wide enough to absorb the drift between two
#: containers of one deployment without absorbing a misconfigured clock.
