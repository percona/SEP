"""drop setting_class CHECK constraint

Revision ID: a38607bba456
Revises: f3a4b5c6d7e8
Create Date: 2026-08-17 22:10:00.000000

Widen ``settingoverride.setting_class`` from a CHECK-constrained enum to a
plain string so an app can declare a settings class without a migration.
The registry, not the database, is now the authority for which classes
exist.

Downgrade re-adds the CHECK with the pre-drop member list and deletes rows
naming a class outside that list.
